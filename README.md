## Usage (all commands are for your terminal)



Check-in what folder you are currently on:
    $pwd (for mac) or $dir (for windows)
Navigate to beer_project folder:
    $cd /.../.../beer_project
Run application:
    $./bin/beer_project
    => this will be output:
        1. Welcome you to our BeerProject
        2. Output our beer selection
        3. You will be asked to select beer by using prompt in your terminal
level 1:
    through prompt, you can select beer by typing number (1..25) or exit for closing the app
level 2:
    After selection beer from our list:
    =>
        1. Confirm your selection with a beer name that matches your selection
        2. Display what we love about that selection and some basic description of that particular beer 
        3. List of options you can choose to get some additional info about your selection
        4. New prompt where you can type numbers that represent additional info or 'back'

You can repeat this action or go type 'back' where you can select a new beer or exit the app.

On your way out we will output 'list of your inquiries' and greet you with an honest wish to see you soon.
