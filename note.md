 <!-- Classes: <!-- 1. Beer <!-- 2. CLI <!-- 3. API <!-- 4. User -->
 1. Api class => take in all the requests and sending, forrmating for beer class
 2. Cli cares about inputs, and decision from users
 3. Beer class 
   at the begining we should create all 25 beers from API class at beginig
   that would be the only time we use "response" 
   from this point on we should comunicate only with Beer class


   all beers, by different caterories
   search by beer name (maybe also by beer type,...)
